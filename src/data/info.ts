      "Last summer I interned as a full-stack developer at TwinMind in Menlo Park, CA. TwinMind is a startup that is building an AI audio recorder that transcribes and summarizes important conversations. I built their web-app from the ground up using Next.js. In the web-app users can upload & record audio files, view past recordings, chat with their recordings, generate AI to-do lists, and more.",

    description:
      "From Dec. 2024 to Apr. 2025, I tutored a young neurodivergent student. One particular challenge we faced was that the student had difficulty reading, specifically understanding what he was reading and picturing it. \n\nThis gave me the idea to create an AI assistant to assist those having difficulty picturing what they read. At HackDavis, my team and I built this idea, calling it VIVI, visual interpretation for verbal input. We built it using React, Python, Computer Vision, and DALLE-3 image generation. In this web-app, we tracked user's gaze to track when they were reading and recorded their voice to generate images that help them visualize what they read.",
